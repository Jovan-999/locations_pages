                How Much Is My Personal Injury Case Worth?

                <p>
                  Every personal injury case is worth a different amount
                  depending on the impact the injuries have on the victimâ€™s life
                  and livelihood. The only way to get an accurate estimate of
                  the value of your claim is to speak to an attorney. Otherwise,
                  you may be able to get a rough idea by looking at the costs of
                  your economic and non-economic damages. Adding up these
                  expenses can give you an idea of what your claim could be
                  worth:
                </p>
                <p>Past and future accident-related medical expenses.</p>
                <p class="process-page__read-paragraph">
                  These may include the costs of hospitalization, surgeries,
                  medications, medical equipment, live-in nursing care,
                  rehabilitation, and home or vehicle modifications.
                  <span class="process-page__read-span">
                    Look at your existing medical bills and what your injuries
                    may cost in the future to calculate these expenses. Lost
                    wages. If your personal injuries force you to miss time at
                    work for treatment and recovery, you could recover for these
                    income losses with your personal injury claim. This includes
                    money you likely would have made in raises and/or promotions
                    during this time. Property damage. Did your home, vehicle,
                    or other properties sustain costly damage in the accident?
                    You could recover the full costs to repair or replace these
                    damaged items. Add in the costs of your property damage to
                    your final calculation. Pain and suffering. The courts will
                    calculate these non-economic losses using expert testimony,
                    medical records, and other evidence of your physical pain
                    and emotional suffering. Values can vary greatly depending
                    on the severity and type of injury. Emotional distress. A PI
                    claim could also result in compensation for emotional harms
                    the accident causes, including mental and psychological
                    damage. You may also recover for lost capacity to earn if
                    your injuries cause permanent disability.
